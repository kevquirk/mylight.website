<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Welcome to <i>MyLight.Website</i>, my name is Kev Quirk and I wrote this entire website by hand to prove that you can still have a good looking, functional website that is quick and light too.</p>

<p><b>This webpage is just 120KB in size and it contains only a single line JavaScript!</b></p>

<p>This site doesn't include any Google call outs either - all fonts are served direct from the web server. So if you're a privacy person, like me, there ain't no Google here! This site also scores 98% on Google PageSpeed Insights.</p>

<p>Once I decided I was going to build this website, I thought it would be a good idea to write a series on <a target="blank" href="https://kevq.uk">my blog</a> about how to build a website just like this one, from scratch.</p>

<p>If you want to start working through my <i>Making A Website</i> series, use the <a href="start.html">Start Here</a> link in the menu bar above. The series is integrated into this website and is designed to be a supplement to the posts on my blog (links available on the <a href="/downloads.html">downloads page</a>). You will start with an extremely simple website, and end with a site that looks just like this.</p>
